Like many of the ideas of the Italian artist and scientist, even the screw was a simple project ever realized in practice. Indeed, Leonardo create a sketch of the project, conceiving the various parts. The aerial screw demonstrates, once again, as Leonardo was a precursor of modern technologies, in fact, on the same mechanism, will be based the helicopter of Enrico Forlanini, invented four hundred years later.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nLeonardo Da Vinci also specified what could be the most suitable materials for the construction of the aircraft: reeds, wood, cloth and wire. In addition, as specified placed in the quote at the beginning of this page, the canvas should have been coated with starch to make it even more impermeable to air, in order to oppose more resistance. The platform of wood have a diameter of 5 meters.\r\n\r\n### Functioning\r\nFour men, placed on the central platform,must turn the mechanism connected to the mast, which also rotates the sail. Scientists believe that the air screw can not fly for a lack of a force that can lift it, but recent studies have found that Leonardo had devised a way to release a force greater than that of the four men. This way is based around the mysterious box placed on the center platform.\r\n\r\n### The mysterious box\r\nThe latest studies on the sketches of Leonardo showed the presence of a box placed on the center platform. This box could hold a spring that was charged by the movement of the four men. Once released, the spring could be able, theoretically, to generate a force capable of lifting, albeit slightly, the air screw. In most physical models this box has not been inserted.\r\n![RealProject](http://www.museoscienza.org/dipartimenti/catalogo_collezioni/images/00006_01.jpg)\r\n\r\n# The animated 3D Project\r\nThe decomposition of the 3D model of the project can be divided into six components: the sail, the beams, the base, the mast, the spars and the tie rods. The sail is definitely the most complex part of the project and has required a special study of its function and form. In this model the box is clearly showed.\r\n![3dProject](http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/1434/prova2n.gif)\r\n\r\n## The Sail\r\n![sail](http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/181/saila.jpg)\r\nFor the sail was originally studied the Archimedean spiral and the formulas that dictate its shape, then was used a **mapping** function associated with a **bidimensional domain** specially designed. This domain goes from 0 to the angle of interest (given by the turns that you want to impress on the sail) and the minimum and maximum radius of the same that dictate the size.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar turns = 1.5;\r\nvar angle = turns * 2 * PI;\r\nvar radius_max = 16;\r\nvar radius_min = 1;\r\nvar height = 15;\r\nvar domain2 = DOMAIN([[0, angle], [radius_min, radius_max]])([120, 4])\r\nvar mapping = function (p) {\r\n  var a = p[0];\r\n  var r = p[1] * (1 + a / angle);\r\n  var h = height - (a / angle * height);\r\n  return [r * -COS(a), r * SIN(a), h];\r\n};\r\nvar sail = MAP(mapping)(domain2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Beams\r\n![beams](http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/4072/travi.jpg)\r\nFor the particular form of the beams was used the **BEZIER_CURVES**. Four curves enclose 2 surfaces and creates the singular beam. \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar domain = INTERVALS(1)(50);\r\nvar domain2 = DOMAIN([[0,1],[0,1]])([30,50])\r\nvar domain3 = DOMAIN([[0,1],[0,1],[0,1]])([30,50])\r\n\r\n\r\nvar sezMcp1 = [[0,0,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],\r\n[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[0.5,0,0]]\r\nvar sezMc1 = BEZIER(S0)(sezMcp1);\r\n\r\nvar sezMcp2 = [[0,0,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],\r\n[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],\r\n[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],[0.5,0,0.5]]\r\nvar sezMc2 = BEZIER(S0)(sezMcp2);\r\n\r\n//Surface 1\r\nvar sur = BEZIER(S1)([sezMc1,sezMc2])\r\nvar rSur = MAP(sur)(domain2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvar bordP1 = [[0,0,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],[6,7,0],\r\n[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[6,7,0.5],[0,0,0.5]]\r\nvar bordC1 = BEZIER(S0)(bordP1);\r\n\r\n\r\nvar bordP2 = [[0.5,0,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],[6,6.5,0],\r\n[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],\r\n[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],[6,6.5,0.5],[0.5,0,0.5]]\r\nvar bordC2 = BEZIER(S0)(bordP2);\r\n\r\n\r\n//Surface 2\r\nvar sur2 = BEZIER(S1)([bordC1,bordC2])\r\nvar rSur2 = MAP(sur2)(domain2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nA **rotational transformation**, with a **scale function** creates the 4 beams.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar support = STRUCT([rSur,rSur2])\r\n\r\nvar supportPos = T([0,1,2])([-19,0.2,0.5])(S([0,2])([3,3])(R([1,2])([PI/2])(support)))\r\n\r\n\r\nvar supportStruct = STRUCT([supportPos, rotSpars, supportPos, rotSpars, supportPos, rotSpars, supportPos])\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Base\r\n![base](http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/928/basemv.jpg)\r\nFor the base was used the **CYL_SURFACE** function for the two bases with the **DISK** function. But a bug in the alpha of plasm.js has forced the use of another way to close the cylindric surfaces. So was used a **domain with a mapping function** that creates a disk.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar b = CYL_SURFACE([16,1])([100,1])\r\nvar angle = 2 * PI;\r\nvar radius = 16;\r\nvar domain3 = DOMAIN([[0, angle], [0, radius]])([120, 4])\r\n\r\nvar mapping3 = function (p) {\r\n  var a = p[0];\r\n  var r = p[1];\r\n  return [r * COS(a), r * SIN(a),0];\r\n};\r\nvar d = MAP(mapping3)(domain3);\r\n\r\nvar dPos = T([2])([1])(d)\r\n\r\nvar base1 = STRUCT([b,dPos]) \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Mast\r\n![mastTip](http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/2994/masttip.jpg)\r\nThe mast was divided in the mast itself and the tip. The mast was created with a simply **CYL_SURFACE**, the tip instead has required the creation of a domain that, with a mapping functions, creates the particular pointed form.\r\n```\r\nvar angle = 2 * PI;\r\nvar radius = 0.5; \r\nvar altezza = 2; \r\nvar domain3 = DOMAIN([[0, angle], [0, radius], [0, altezza]])([30, 4, 4]); \r\nvar mapping3 = function (p) { \r\n  var a = p[0];  \r\n  var r = p[1];  \r\n  var z = p[2]; \r\n  return [z * r * COS(a), z * r * SIN(a), altezza - z]; \r\n}; \r\nvar tip = MAP(mapping3)(domain3); \r\n\r\nvar posTip = T([2])([38])(tip)\r\n \r\nvar mast = STRUCT([posMast, posTip])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Spars and the Box\r\n![spars](http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6836/box1t.jpg)\r\nFor one spar was used the same technique of the mast and the base: a **CYL_SURFACE** and a **mapped domain** to close the surface and a **rotational function** to generate all the four spars.\r\nThe two spars on the sail was generated with a **SCALE** function starting from one of the base spar.\r\nThe box was generated with a **CUBOID** function\r\n\r\n## The Tie Rods\r\n\r\nFor the tie rods was used several **POLYLINE** functions\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar tir1 = POLYLINE([[8.8,18,0],[11,13,33.4]])\r\nvar tir2 = POLYLINE([[17.9,8,0],[19,7,32.5]])\r\nvar tir3 = POLYLINE([[-12,16,0],[-11,13,35.6]])\r\nvar tir4 = POLYLINE([[-17.8,8,0],[-21,3,26.5]])\r\nvar tir5 = POLYLINE([[-8.8,-18,0],[-11,-13,28.3]])\r\nvar tir6 = POLYLINE([[-17.9,-8,0],[-22,-10,27.7]])\r\nvar tir7 = POLYLINE([[8.8,-18,0],[11,-13,30.6]])\r\nvar tir8 = POLYLINE([[17.9,-8,0],[20,-5,31.6]])\r\n\r\nvar tirs = STRUCT([tir1,tir2,tir3,tir4,tir5,tir6,tir7,tir8])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The animation\r\nThe animation is constituted by a \"Fly()\" function which actives a javascript \"confirm\" message to the user. In case of an affirmative answer, a **\"setInterval()\" function** is activated and calls a rotational funtion applied to the elements of the model that have to rotate.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction Fly() {\r\n  var message = 'Do you want to activate the movement of the Vite Aerea?'\r\n\r\n  var choice = confirm(message)\r\n\r\n  if (choice == true) {\r\n    setInterval(function () {\r\n    vite.rotate([0,1], PI/45);\r\n    }, 60);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other images of the completed 3d model\r\n![vite2](http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/8923/viteb.jpg)\r\n![vite3](http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/3538/vitec.jpg)\r\n![vite4](http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9983/vited.jpg)\r\n![vite5](http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/8531/viteas.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgements\r\nThanks to [Enrico Marino](https://github.com/onirame) for the support.\r\nAnd thanks to Annalisa Ghelardini for her feminine touch.
